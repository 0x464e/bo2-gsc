# BO2 GameScripts
Some more notable game script mods I've made for Call of Duty Black Ops II.  
Most of my GSC work was helping others on forums or creating little snippets years and years ago which are long lost by now, so this repository isn't too impressive. But it's a good memories archive for myself.

## The Scripts
### UnlimitedAmmoPowerUp.gsc
While most of my GSC work was done during BO2 prime years around 2015, this one is quite recent even. I made and released it on the [Plutonium forums](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/70/release-gsc-zombies-custom-powerup-unlimited-ammo) when Plutonium BO2 was popular in early 2020. A little over 2,000 views my post there seems to have got, so it was a decent success considering how small the community is.

The script adds a custom power-up to zombies, unlimited ammo or "Bottomless Clip", as I call it in the in-game pop-ups.

### Superman.gsc
>**<u>Made in 2014-2015</u>**

A nice little mod menu I made and used for hosting "superman lobbies" back in 2014-2015.  
By modern superman mod standards this is obviously trash, but during its time, pretty much everything we did had never been seen before.  
That's probably also why our YouTube videos of the lobbies were such successes getting views in the hundreds of thousands.  
The script obviously went through countless of iterations for whenever we had an idea for a new shot to go for. Most stuff was just added in as a quick keybind and then removed once the shot had been hit. I don't know which version the file is on right now.

It's not one of those 100k+ view videos that were uploaded to community channels <sub><sup>(such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IXbGzYthMI) for example)</sup></sub>, but it's my favorite episode. Haters even accused us of nac mods, but in reality hours upon hours were spent on hitting the shots.

### SomeTrickshotMenu.gsc
Surely to most uninteresting script, but its got some interesting stuff in there that I was happy of when I made it.  
This is a mod menu/mod made for a Plutonium BO2 trickshot server back when they were popular.  
Someone paid me to make this mod for them and they hosted their server with this mod.
